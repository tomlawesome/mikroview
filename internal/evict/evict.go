// Package evict bounds maps whose keys come from untrusted input.
//
// Several of mikroview's in-memory indexes are keyed on something an
// attacker chooses: a source MAC, a RouterOS log-prefix, a source
// address. Each is capped, and the cap is what stops the map growing
// without limit. How the cap is *enforced* turns out to matter as much
// as the cap itself.
//
// Evicting back to exactly the cap means the map is full again
// immediately, so the very next new key overflows too, and the scan
// runs again -- and again, for every subsequent event. Measured on
// internal/detect before it was fixed: 5.78 us/event with recurring
// sources against 504.96 us/event under all-distinct spoofed ones, an
// 87x slowdown that capped the detector near 2000 events/s, past which
// it silently dropped events. That is the tool failing at its one job,
// quietly, in exactly the conditions it exists for.
//
// Shedding a batch instead amortises the scan: the next n/8 new keys
// are free, so the per-event cost is the sort divided by the batch size
// rather than a whole sort. One eighth keeps the map comfortably full,
// so genuine long-lived entries are not evicted early.
//
// internal/detect solved this first and this package is that solution
// generalised, after #285 found the same eviction-to-exactly-the-cap
// pattern still live in internal/device and internal/rules. Keeping one
// implementation is the point -- the comment it replaced already
// recorded that six hand-copied versions had drifted once before.
