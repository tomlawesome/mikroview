// The admin-issued one-time reset code (#1251, from #1245 decision 3).
//
// mikroview sends no mail of any kind, so there is no "reset link in
// your inbox" to fall back on: an admin resets an account and reads the
// code out to its owner in person or over a call they trust. Everything
// about the shape below follows from that -- it is a string a human
// dictates and another human types, once, under a deadline.

// resetCodeAlphabet is deliberately 32 characters with every ambiguous
// pair removed: no 0/O, no 1/I/l. A code that is read aloud or copied
// off a screen must not have a "was that a one or an ell" in it, since
// the person retyping it has no way to check and gets a flat "invalid
// username or password" when they guess wrong.
//
// Exactly 32 (2^5) is also what lets newResetCode below index the
// alphabet with a five-bit mask rather than a modulo, so every character
// is uniformly likely without rejection sampling.
