// ValidateUsername rejects a username that would be unsafe downstream.
//
// Three things are refused, each for a specific reason:
//
//   - Control characters (C0, C1, DEL). An ANSI escape in a username is
//     executed by the operator's terminal when they run -list-users, and
//     a newline forges a whole extra line in the audit trail. This is
//     the defect behind CVE-2025-55754 (Tomcat, ANSI escapes reaching
//     console output) and CVE-2025-48432 (Django, crafted input reaching
//     logs unescaped).
//
//   - Unicode format characters (category Cf). These include the bidi
//     overrides -- U+202E RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE and friends -- which
//     let a username render as something other than what it is. In an
//     account list whose whole purpose is telling the admin who holds
//     access, an account that displays as another account's name is a
//     real problem.
//
//   - Leading or trailing whitespace. " admin" and "admin" look
//     identical in a list, and the store's uniqueness check is on the
//     lowercased string, so both can exist at once.
//
// Deliberately not an allowlist of ASCII. Plenty of legitimate people
// have non-ASCII names, and refusing them to save a validation function
// is not a security decision.
//
// The "no email addresses" rule (#1252) is deliberately *not* here: an
// identity provider's preferred_username claim is usually an email, and
// this function is what sanitiseUsernameHint runs over that claim. It
// lives in ValidateLocalUsername instead, which only local account
// creation calls.

// ValidateLocalUsername is ValidateUsername plus the one rule that

//
// The reason is that it makes a clash impossible rather than checkable.
// An SSO-provisioned account is usually named by the provider's
// preferred_username or email claim, which is an email address; a local
// account never is; so the two namespaces are disjoint and nothing ever
// has to compare an address to decide whether a returning identity is
// "the same person" as an existing local account. It also means
// mikroview stores no email address anywhere, which is the standing
// rule this keeps (#1245 decision 3).
//
// Any "@" is refused, not just a well-formed address. The purpose is a
// namespace that cannot overlap with what providers send, so something
// half-way to an address ("tom@", "tom@corp") is refused too; there is
// no legitimate local name that needs one.
//
// Called from createLocked -- the single funnel for Register and
// CreateUser -- and so at creation only. It is never applied at
// sign-in: an account created before this rule and named as an email
// keeps working, because refusing it then would lock out someone who
// cannot fix it.

// sanitiseUsernameHint applies ValidateUsername -- not
// ValidateLocalUsername -- to an identity provider's
// preferred_username/email claim, returning "" if it is not usable as a

//
// The email rule is deliberately skipped here. An SSO-provisioned
// account being named by its email claim is the normal case and what
// keeps the two namespaces disjoint (see ValidateLocalUsername);
// refusing it would rename half of an operator's people to
// `oidc-<hash>` for no gain.
//
// Returning "" rather than an error is the point. The claim is
// controlled by the identity provider, not by mikroview, and the person
// signing in has already authenticated successfully -- refusing the
// login because their IdP sent an awkward display name would lock out
// someone who did nothing wrong and cannot fix it. An empty hint makes
// uniqueUsernameLocked fall back to its deterministic `oidc-<hash>`
// name, so they still get a stable account.
