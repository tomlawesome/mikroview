// The first admin is created with a one-time setup code (#1415). An
// empty accounts store is not only a fresh install: a deleted file, a
// wrong path or a botched restore all start a server with no accounts,
// and until this code existed the first visitor took admin. Now whoever
// registers first has to show the code, and the code is only ever shown
// in the server's own log -- so taking admin needs access to the server,
// not just its address.
//
// The design is gauntlet's ADR-0003 (which follows orbit's ADR-0022),
// with the same names, so moving onto gauntlet (#1202) is a swap: made
// when a persisted store opens empty, kept in process memory only (never
// written to the document or anywhere else), announced once, compared in
// constant time, inert as soon as any account exists, and gone with the
// process -- a lost code means restart and read the log again. There is
// no clock expiry and no CLI to print it: a CLI's own process cannot see
// the server's code, and CreateUser does not make admins
// (ErrSingleAdmin), so a CLI opening the store for one command passes an
// Options.OnSetupCode that does nothing.
//
// The code is checked here, in the store, so every HTTP caller shares
// one check; Register itself stays the host-side primitive the register
// handler calls after it.

// SetupCodeHandler receives the setup code an empty store announces --
// Options.OnSetupCode. An interface rather than a bare func to match
// gauntlet's, where it keeps Options comparable; SetupCodeFunc adapts a
// plain function, as http.HandlerFunc does.
