"""Enforce per-package Go coverage floors, and ratchet them upward.

Ported from birdcage's scripts/coverage-floor.py (#1333), which #1290
found had nothing reading `coverage.out` at all -- it was measured and
kept as a CI artifact, and nothing failed on a regression. This is the
mechanism that reads it.

This checks STATEMENT coverage: every percentage here and in
supply-chain/coverage-floors.yml is "how many statements ran at least
once". That is the only number Go's own tooling produces.

Do not read that as "branches are invisible" -- it is narrower than it
sounds, and the difference matters when deciding what this file does not
protect. An untaken branch IS caught, because a body that never runs is
uncovered statements: a function whose true path is never taken reports
66.7%, not 100%.

What statement coverage cannot see is a compound condition. `if a && b`
reports 100% having only ever run (true, true) and (false, true): `b` was
never independently decisive, and no number says so. That is the gap
MC/DC exists to close, and the reason DO-178C and IEC 61508 ask for it at
their highest levels rather than asking for a percentage.

Per-package percentages are computed by attributing each block in the Go
coverage profile to the directory of its source file (the package), and
summing statement counts weighted the same way `go test`'s own per-package
summary line does: a package's coverage is (statements with count > 0) /
(statements). It matches `go test`'s own "coverage: X% of statements"
lines for the same profile because `go test`'s default -coverpkg only
instruments the package under test, so nothing in the merged profile
belongs to any package other than the one whose tests produced it.

Rules enforced, each one a `problems` entry below:
  - a package below its floor: coverage regressed, or a floor was set wrong.
  - a package in the coverage profile but absent from the floors file: a new
    package must not slip in unmeasured -- adding its floor is a reviewed
    change to supply-chain/coverage-floors.yml, not something this script
    does silently.
  - a package sitting more than RATCHET_SLACK points ABOVE its floor: a floor
    that never rises is a target, not a ratchet. This is what makes it one.

Exit codes: 0 clean; 1 one of the rules above fired; 2 the profile or the
floors file could not be read or parsed (fail red, never quietly green).

Usage: coverage-floor.py <coverage.out> [floors.yml]
  floors.yml defaults to supply-chain/coverage-floors.yml, resolved relative
  to the current directory -- run this from the repository root.

YAML parsing: hand-rolled, not PyYAML, the same choice
scripts/ci-changed-paths-guard.py makes for .gitlab-ci.yml's own lists --
coverage-floors.yml only ever has one flat `floors:` mapping of
`package: integer  # comment`, and a dozen lines of hand-parsing that shape
is simpler to read and audit than pulling in a parser for a format this
file never uses.

# How far a package may drift above its floor before this job asks for the
# floor to be raised. Set deliberately loose.
#
# The ratchet only works if the floors track reality, so drift has to be
# caught. But the action that causes drift is somebody adding tests, and a
# check that fails the build for improving coverage teaches people to stop
# improving coverage -- or to switch the check off. A tight value here
# punishes the good move: on a small package a single new test moves the
# percentage several points at once.
#
# Five points is the compromise: small improvements land without ceremony,
# and a package that has genuinely pulled ahead still gets its floor
# raised rather than quietly keeping a floor nobody has looked at in
# months. Raise this if it turns out to nag; do not remove it, or the
# floors rot and the ratchet becomes decoration.
